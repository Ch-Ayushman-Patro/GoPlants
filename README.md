## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- pip package manager
- At least 4GB RAM (for model loading)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GoPlants.git
cd GoPlants
```

2. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Ensure model file exists:**
   - The application requires `model2.keras` in the project directory
   - If missing, train the model using `model-creation.ipynb`

---

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Launch the GUI application:**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Using the classifier:**
   - Click **"Upload Image"** to select a plant image from your computer
   - The image will be displayed in the preview area
   - Click **"Classify Image"** to identify the plant
   - View the prediction result with confidence level

### Expected Output

**High Confidence (≥40%):**
```
Predicted Class: mango
Confidence Level: 0.87
```

**Low Confidence (<40%):**
```
⚠️ Unpredictable: The uploaded item cannot be reliably classified.
```

## Model Details

### Architecture

The model uses a **custom CNN architecture** with the following components:

- **Convolutional Blocks**: Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- **Batch Normalization**: For stable training and faster convergence
- **Max Pooling**: For spatial dimension reduction
- **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting (rate: 0.5)
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with 512 and 256 neurons
- **Output Layer**: 30-class softmax for plant classification

### Training Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Input Size** | 150 x 150 pixels |
| **Training Images** | 23,972 images |
| **Validation Images** | 3,030 images |
| **Test Images** | 2,998 images |
| **Batch Size** | 32 |
| **Classes** | 30 plant species |
| **Trainable Parameters** | ~11.4M |
| **Non-trainable Parameters** | ~7.6M |

### Data Augmentation

To improve model robustness, the following augmentations were applied:

- **Rotation**: ±20 degrees
- **Width/Height Shift**: ±20%
- **Shear Transformation**: 20%
- **Zoom**: ±20%
- **Horizontal Flip**: Random
- **Fill Mode**: Nearest neighbor

## How It Works

### 1. **Image Upload**
   - User selects an image through the file dialog
   - Image is displayed in the GUI (resized to 200x200 for preview)

### 2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Image is resized to 150x150 pixels (model input size)
   - Pixel values are normalized to [0, 1] range
   - Image is converted to a batch format (1, 150, 150, 3)

### 3. **Model Prediction**
   - Preprocessed image is fed to the CNN model
   - Model outputs probability distribution across 30 classes
   - Highest probability class is selected as prediction

### 4. **Confidence Check**
   - If confidence < 40%: Display uncertainty warning
   - If confidence ≥ 40%: Display predicted class and confidence

### 5. **Result Display**
   - Results are shown in the GUI with appropriate formatting
   - Threading ensures the UI remains responsive during classification
